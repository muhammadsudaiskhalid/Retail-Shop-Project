## üìñ Introduction

The Retail Shop Management System is a simple yet effective C++ program designed to manage product records within a retail store. This console-based application offers comprehensive inventory management capabilities including adding new products, displaying product details, calculating total stock value, searching for products, updating product information, and removing products from inventory.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete products from inventory
- **Inventory Display**: View all products in a well-formatted table
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find specific products by name
- **Stock Valuation**: Calculate total value of entire inventory
- **Colorful Interface**: Enhanced visual presentation with console colors
- **Data Validation**: Basic input validation and error handling
- **Menu-Driven**: Easy-to-navigate menu system
- **Capacity Management**: Supports up to 100 products with overflow protection

## üèóÔ∏è Program Structure

The program follows a modular design approach:

- **Struct-based Data Storage**: Uses `Product` struct to store product information
- **Function-based Operations**: Each functionality is encapsulated in separate functions
- **Console-based Interface**: Interactive menu-driven user experience
- **Array Management**: Efficient product array handling for CRUD operations

### Data Structure
```cpp
struct Product {
    string name;      // Product name
    int price;        // Product price in Rs.
    int quantity;     // Available quantity
};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Libraries**: 
  - `iostream` - Input/output operations
  - `windows.h` - Console color management
- **Development Environment**: Any C++ compiler (Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, etc.)

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - C++ compiler installed on your system
   - Windows OS (for color functionality)

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadsudaiskhalid/retail-shop-management.git
   cd retail-shop-management
   ```

3. **Compile the program**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o retail_shop main.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./retail_shop
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Main Menu Options

1. **Add a new product** - Register new inventory items
2. **Display product details** - View all products in tabular format  
3. **Calculate total value** - Get total worth of inventory
4. **Search for a product** - Find specific products by name
5. **Update product** - Modify existing product details
6. **Delete product** - Remove products from inventory
7. **Exit** - Close the application
